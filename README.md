### [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) System Engineering Plus

Studies carried out in the **[ALX Software Engineering Plus](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-plus/)** course

<br />

#### Technologies

* Bash:     5.1-6ubuntu1
* Docker:   24.0.5
* GCC:      9.4.0
* Ubuntu:   20.04 LTS

<br />

#### Learning Objectives

* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to `explain to anyone`, **without the help of Google**:
    * What is a binary tree
    * What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
    * What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
    * What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
    * What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
    * What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

<br />

#### Requirements: C

* Allowed editors:
    * _[vi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vi-editor-unix/)_
    * _[vim](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-vim-editor-in-linux/)_
    * _[emacs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/emacs-command-in-linux-with-examples/)_

* All source code:
    * Will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options
        * `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
    * Not to use `stdlib's` _[system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-call-in-c/)_
    * To end with a new line
    * To have no errors and no warnings during compilation
    * To use the _[Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty)_ style.
    * To have it's best practices checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

* A README.md file at the root of:
    * The repo, containing a description of the repository
    * The folder of each project, containing a description of the project
